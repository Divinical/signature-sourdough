# 🥖 Signature Sourdough – Landing Page

A clean, single-page website for **Signature Sourdough**, a small-batch artisan bakery based in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis. This site is being built in collaboration with Nadine (founder/baker) and will showcase her core bread offerings, story, and ordering info.

> Built using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev), with final deployment via Netlify once images and content are approved.
